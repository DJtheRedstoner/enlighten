Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why is Enlighten called Enlighten?
----------------------------------

A progress bar's purpose is to inform the user about an ongoing process.
Enlighten, meaning "to inform", seems a fitting name.
(Plus any names related to progress were already taken)


Is Windows supported?
---------------------

Enlighten works relatively well in Linux-like subsystems for Windows such as
`Cygwin <https://cygwin.com/>`_ and
`Windows Subsystem for Linux <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux>`_.

Native support for Windows versions 10.0.10586 and newer is experimental
and does not support resizing.

Earlier versions do not easily support the scroll window setting that Enlighten's key features
depend on. That said, we are looking at ways to expand Windows support,
`patches <https://github.com/Rockhopper-Technologies/enlighten/pulls>`_ welcomed.
