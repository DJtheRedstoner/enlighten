Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why is Enlighten called Enlighten?
----------------------------------

A progress bar's purpose is to inform the user about an ongoing process.
Enlighten, meaning "to inform", seems a fitting name.
(Plus any names related to progress were already taken)


Is Windows supported?
---------------------

Native support for Windows versions 10.0.10586 and newer is experimental
and does not support resizing.

Earlier version of Windows are supported when
`ANSICON <https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon>`_ is used.
Support is experimental and does not support resizing.

Enlighten also works relatively well in Linux-like subsystems for Windows such as
`Cygwin <https://cygwin.com/>`_ or
`Windows Subsystem for Linux <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux>`_.

`Issues <https://github.com/Rockhopper-Technologies/enlighten/issues>`_ and
