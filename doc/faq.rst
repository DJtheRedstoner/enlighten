Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why is Enlighten called Enlighten?
----------------------------------

A progress bar's purpose is to inform the user about an ongoing process.
Enlighten, meaning "to inform", seems a fitting name.
(Plus any names related to progress were already taken)


Is Windows supported?
---------------------

It hasn't been tested, but Enlighten is generally subject to the same
`limitations <http://blessed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#brief-overview>`_
as the `blessed <https://github.com/jquast/blessed>`_ module.

If you have ideas,
`patches <https://github.com/Rockhopper-Technologies/enlighten/pulls>`_
are welcomed.
