Overview
========

Enlighten Progress Bar is a console progress bar library for Python.

The main advantage of Enlighten is it allows writing to stdout and stderr without any
redirection or additional code. Just print or log as you normally would.

Enlighten also includes experimental support for Jupyter Notebooks.
